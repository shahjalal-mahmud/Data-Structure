# 📘 Data Structures Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures practice repository! This project is dedicated to showcasing my journey of learning and implementing various data structures as part of my university course. Here, I explore fundamental concepts, write code to practice them, and regularly update this repository as I learn new topics.

## 📖 About This Project

This repository contains my practice codes for data structures in **C++**. Each code example is part of my journey to master core data structures, which are essential for problem-solving in computer science. From arrays to trees, each structure is implemented with care, often including comments to explain the logic and thought process.

## 🛠️ Implemented Data Structures

Here are some of the key data structures I've implemented so far:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms

> **Note:** This list will continue to grow as I update this repository with new topics.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

You can browse through this single code file to see all the implementations in one place. Each data structure is separated by comments for easy navigation.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/DataStructuresPractice.git](https://github.com/shahjalal-mahmud/Data-Structure.git)
    ```
2. **Compile the Code**:
    - Use a C++ compiler like `g++`:
      ```bash
      g++ data_structures.cpp -o data_structures
      ./data_structures
      ```

## ✨ Features

- Organized code for easy understanding
- Simple, beginner-friendly implementations of essential data structures
- Constantly updated with new examples and optimizations
- Focused on clear, readable code to aid learning

## 📝 Examples

Here are a few example implementations you'll find in this repository:

- **Linked List Operations**:
    ```cpp
    // Function to add a node at the end
    void append(int data) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(data);
        if(!head) {
            head = newNode;
            return;
        }
        Node* temp = head;
        while(temp->next) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = newNode;
    }
    ```

## 🌱 Getting Started
